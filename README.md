This paper outlines a pioneering, systematic, quantitative approach to the design and architecture of a decentralized single sign on (SSO) based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

Single sign-on (SSO) lets users access authorized network resources with one login. SSO has brought about unprecedented convenience on an unimagined scale. However, convenience came at a steep cost -- Centralized SSO servers. Think Single Point of Failure and increased cyber attack risk. Most importantly, centralized SSO servers mean one's identity is no longer in one's control of one identity. 

Now, imagine being able to enjoy the convenience of Single Sign On without the cost. 

This paper proposes a decentralized single sign (DApp) built on an identity trust fabric (ITF) which leverage an interoperable protocol that connects different blockchains together and allow individuals to access different digital assets on different blockchain (ethereum, bitcoin, ripplenet) through a single sign on Decentralized App (DApp). At the most fundamental level it uses DIDs.

Using one's Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), one can unlock and transfer digital asset from one blockchain to another. Using Decentralized Single Single On based on Decentralized Identifiers, one is able to enjoy the convenience without the drawbacks of centralization.

More to come.
